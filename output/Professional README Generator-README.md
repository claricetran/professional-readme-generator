# Professional README Generator

## Description

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)

This professional README generator was made with Node.js. It is a command-line application that takes in user input for a README.md file and writes a file into an output folder. I was able to practice using Node.js and the npm, Inquirer, in making this application. This application allows for easier creation of a README.md since the user doesn't have to handle any of the formatting.

## Installation

To install this application, please clone the repository. Open in VS Code and open the integrated terminal. In the terminal, run npm install. Then, run node index.js.

## Usage

To use, answer the prompts that appear in the terminal. Once all prompts are answered, the newly written README.md file will be in the output folder. It can be renamed as necessary.
